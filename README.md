# About The Project

This is a smartlink (A link that connects to multiple links) project which is built for mostly musicians who have to post multiple links when sharing the music. With this project, all you need to do is put all the links in one place, and share one link that will give the fans an option to choose their preffered platform. It is a problem for artists that need to share dozens of links when they want to market their music, we bridge that gap with an SAHHLink.
